Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud
------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to my Microservices Practice Repository! This repository showcases the microservices I have built and practiced on my own, using Java, Spring Boot, and related technologies.

What I Have Learned
------------------------------
I have covered both essential and advanced topics in microservices architecture, including:

**REST Basics**: I learned to build and consume RESTful APIs.

**Centralized Configuration**: I used Spring Cloud Config for centralized configuration management.

**Inter-Service Communication**: I implemented communication between microservices using Feign clients and RestTemplate.

**Eureka Server**: I worked on service discovery and registration using Eureka Server.

**Resilience Mechanisms**: I applied circuit breakers and retries with Resilience4j to enhance fault tolerance.

**Security**: I secured microservices using JWT and OAuth2.

**Docker Deployment**: I containerized and deployed microservices with Docker.
